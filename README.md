# Password Manager

Simple GUI Python application for Accounts and Secrets management (Secrets unlike Account have only password without username or e-mail, examples are Wi-Fi password, PIN code, etc.).
GUI is realized using Tkiner package.
Currently only required dependencies are [jsonpickle](https://pypi.org/project/jsonpickle/) and [pyperclip](https://pypi.org/project/paperclip/)
Most features are available, but a lot of refactoring is required

More details will be added soon...
